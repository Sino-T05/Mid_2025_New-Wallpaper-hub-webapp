## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of WallpaperHub seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please send an email to: **security@wallpaperhub.com** (or your actual security email)

Include the following information:
- Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Regular Updates**: We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process
- **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days

### Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask that you:
- Give us reasonable time to investigate and fix the issue before public disclosure
- Avoid accessing, modifying, or deleting data that doesn't belong to you
- Don't perform actions that could harm the service or its users
- Don't access or download data from our systems

## Security Measures

### Application Security

- **Authentication**: Secure email/password authentication via Supabase
- **Authorization**: Row Level Security (RLS) for all database operations
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation, size limits, and secure storage
- **HTTPS Only**: All communications encrypted in transit
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored securely

### Database Security

- **Row Level Security**: Enabled on all tables
- **Prepared Statements**: Protection against SQL injection
- **Access Controls**: Principle of least privilege
- **Audit Logging**: Database operations logged
- **Backup Encryption**: Encrypted backups

### Infrastructure Security

- **Supabase Security**: Leveraging Supabase's enterprise-grade security
- **CDN Protection**: DDoS protection and edge caching
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies updated regularly
- **Security Headers**: Proper HTTP security headers
- **CORS Configuration**: Restricted cross-origin requests

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Input validation
function uploadImage(file: File) {
  if (!file || file.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
    throw new Error('Invalid file')
  }
  // Process file
}

// ❌ Bad: No validation
function uploadImage(file: File) {
  // Direct processing without validation
}
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# ✅ Good: Use environment variables for secrets
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# ❌ Bad: Hardcoded secrets in code
const supabaseUrl = 'https://hardcoded-url.supabase.co'
```

### Authentication

```typescript
// ✅ Good: Check authentication
if (!user) {
  throw new Error('Authentication required')
}

// ❌ Bad: Assume user is authenticated
const result = await performAction(user.id)
```

## Common Vulnerabilities and Mitigations

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Mitigation**: React's built-in XSS protection, input sanitization
- **Implementation**: All user content is properly escaped

### SQL Injection
- **Mitigation**: Supabase's prepared statements and RLS
- **Implementation**: No direct SQL queries from client

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- **Mitigation**: SameSite cookies, CORS configuration
- **Implementation**: Supabase handles CSRF protection

### File Upload Vulnerabilities
- **Mitigation**: File type validation, size limits, virus scanning
- **Implementation**: Server-side validation before storage

### Authentication Bypass
- **Mitigation**: Supabase Auth with proper session management
- **Implementation**: RLS policies enforce access control
